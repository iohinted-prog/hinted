                Why Hinted exists
              </h2>
              <p className="text-[17px] leading-8 text-slate-700">
                Giving thoughtful gifts should feel exciting, not stressful.
                Hinted was created to make it easier to stay on top of
                birthdays, celebrations, and meaningful moments without relying
                on scattered notes, forgotten tabs, or last-minute scrambling.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[17px] leading-8 text-slate-700">
                The goal is simple: help people become more intentional in their
                relationships by making reminders, gift discovery, and planning
                feel beautifully organised in one place.

                How the experience works
              </h2>
              <p className="text-[17px] leading-8 text-slate-700">
                Hinted has two connected layers. The public side introduces the
                product, the idea behind it, and a preview of gifting content
                for new visitors. The signed-in experience becomes more personal,
                with features such as onboarding, saved ideas, reminders, and
                account-based planning.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[17px] leading-8 text-slate-700">
                This structure allows Hinted to feel approachable at first
                glance while still supporting a richer product experience for
                returning users.

                Our approach
              </h2>
              <p className="text-[17px] leading-8 text-slate-700">
                We believe the best gifting tools should be useful, calm, and
                personal. Hinted is being built to reduce friction around
                remembering, planning, and discovering, while keeping the focus
                on real relationships rather than generic shopping.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[17px] leading-8 text-slate-700">
                As Hinted grows, the aim is to keep improving how people
                organise their ideas, manage important moments, and give with
                more confidence and thought.
