              </h2>
              <p className="text-[17px] leading-8 text-slate-700">
                HintDrop offers a group gifting feature called Circles that allows a group of people to pool contributions toward a shared purchase. By creating or joining a circle, you agree to the following:
              </p>
              <ul className="space-y-3 text-[17px] leading-8 text-slate-700">
                <li>
                  - <strong>Organiser responsibility.</strong> The person who creates a circle (the organiser) is solely responsible for using the pooled funds to make the intended purchase. HintDrop facilitates the collection and transfer of funds but is not a party to the transaction between organisers and members. HintDrop is not liable if an organiser fails to make the purchase or misuses the funds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  - <strong>Pot types.</strong> Circles operate under one of three funding modes: Flexible (members contribute what they want and funds are released when the target is reached), All-or-nothing (funds are only released if the full target is met by the deadline, otherwise contributions are refunded), or Organiser covers gap (the organiser tops up any shortfall to reach the target). The applicable mode is shown clearly when you join a circle.
                </li>
                <li>
                  - <strong>Platform fee.</strong> The circle target amount already includes any applicable payment processing costs and HintDrop platform fee. The fee breakdown is shown when creating a circle.
                </li>
                <li>
                  - <strong>Payments.</strong> HintDrop does not process payments for circles. Contributions are arranged directly between members outside of the platform. HintDrop is not responsible for any payment disputes between members.
                </li>
                <li>
                  - <strong>Refunds.</strong> Since payments are arranged directly between members, HintDrop is not responsible for issuing refunds. Any refund disputes should be resolved between the organiser and contributors directly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  - <strong>Disputes between members.</strong> HintDrop is a platform and is not responsible for disputes between circle members or between members and organisers. We encourage users to only participate in circles with people they trust.
